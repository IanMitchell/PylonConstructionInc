n my opinion, I would have to say this is one of the most hardest matchups for protoss. Terran blocks are very annoying

when it comes to scouting or attacking. Most players nowadays prefer going all vultures/tanks when they find out their

opponents are protoss. A typical terran build begins with an entrance block consisting of 2 supplies and 1 barracks. 

When scouting with your 10th probe, try killing off his scv that's building a barracks so you can slow him down or scout

and try leaving your probe inside his base so you can scout with it again later on.



No blockup but fast gas

Usually when I see a terran that doesn't block up. I concentrate on zealots and rush him when I have 5. Most likely he's 

going for fast medics then adding 1 or 2 firebats to his small marine army. Remember to tech when you have the extra 

minerals and get dragoons ASAP! Any terran player that wants to win using marines/medics/firebats has to do so by winning 

the game early on or hurting your economy, it's almost impossible for terran to win with an all infantry army against 

protoss mid/late game.



Blockup and fast gas

Most likely your opponent is doing the common vulture/tank attack. When dealing with this type of player, you have 2 

choices. You either rush him or you take do it the long way. When rushing a terran player, send 1 zealot then 2 zealots 

nonstop while tech-ing it up to dark templars, skip dragoons. Then I would upgrade zealot speed followed by attack +1. 



If they are too far, you will have to expand as soon as possible and get a dropship to protect you ledges from tank 

drops. Zealots and dark templars are usually the way to go. I find that dragoons are too bulky when running up ramps 

after you cast disruption web.



Blockup but late gas


Generally when you see this, it means he's going for an all infantry army. This is easy to deal with especially when 

defending. While defending, you would only need 2 cannons and 1 reaver seriously :[
